# weatherApp

This is a simple weather app.
it is based on HTTP request to fetch data from the web like weather data.
the App uses also CLLocationManager class to monitor and find the user location WITHOUT saving those sensitive data anywere. 

Science Weather App is working woth a FireBAse project to have acces to a City list file (more that 200.000 city) in. order to retrive a city and showing the weather 
in the searched location
